# Django-Custom-User
The Djangoâ€™s built-in authentication system is great. For the most part we can use it out-of-the-box, saving a lot of development and testing effort. It fits most of the use cases and is very safe. But sometimes we need to do some fine adjustment so to fit our Web application.

This repository explains step-by-step how to create a Custom User model in Django so that an email address can be used as the primary user identifier instead of a username for authentication. Also added some extra fields such as Mobile Number and Date of birth in Registration form.
